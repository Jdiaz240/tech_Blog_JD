# Tech Blog

completed by Joshua Diaz


## Project Description:

In this assignemnet, I used node.js, express, and sequelize to create a working tech blog. Users will be prompted to login in order to make create a profile and add new postings to their blog. Also they will be able to add comments to their post that they can also publish to be seen on their profile. I learned a great deal about routes and models from this assignment and I hope these skills can be used on future projects both in my academic and professional career.

### Special Note:

Please be advised that due to the intensity of this project as well as the timing of its assignment during the beginning of group Project 2 that the instructional staff graciously provided a fair amount of starter code to lighten the load on the students such as myself. Thank you for taking this into consideration while scanning for plagarism.
